There are two ways to run my cachesim after navigating to the source directory and the tracefile.

1. Compile and run in terminal

Example:
javac CachesimEngine.java
java CachesimEngine tracefile 2 4 8

2. Run .jar file in terminal
*Note my .jar file is called cachesim.jar

Example:
java -jar cachesim.jar tracefile 2 4 8

*Other Note: When I made the jar file in eclipse it passed me an error "JAR export finished with
warnings, see console for details" however it hasn't seemed to cause any problems.
