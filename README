This is a simple cache simulator implemented in Java, its purpose is to show you what happens in a cache
when a given set of instructions are fed in, for each instruction there is a corresponding output that
tells the user what the result of the instruction was.

Compile and run in terminal

javac CachesimEngine.java
java CachesimEngine filename x y z

Where x should be replaced by size of cache in MB (ex 2 => 2MB)
Where y should be replaced by the associativity (ex 4 => 4 way set associative)
Where z should be the size of each block in bytes (ex 8 => 8-byte blocks)

Notes: The replacement policy is LRU, the size of each address is 24-bits, cache is write-through
no allocate, see below for the input file format.

Input file format:

instruction hex-adress size (data)

Example file:

store 0x34ab00 2 19ab
store 0x34ab02 2 18cd
load 0x34ab00 4
store 0x3aab00 2 19dd
store 0x3aab02 2 18bb
load 0x3aab00 4
store 0x34ab00 2 19ab
store 0x34ab02 2 18cd
load 0x34ab00 8
